            I'm sorry to do this, but the system has become unstable and isn't scaling well.
            <br><br>
            Your balances are still here even if you are unable to access garliyard,
            the system is seriously struggling to keep up and is facing the same fate as breadbox.
            <br><br>
            Please withdraw your balances and migrate over to another wallet system such as
            <a href="https://xske.github.io/garlium/">Garlium</a> or <a href="https://garlicwallet.com">GarlicWallet</a>.
